# Installation.

This is still a todo work. It is not intended to be installable yet, but installability will be tested in a new branch

# What is molnim?

Molnim (from the words mole and manim) is a manim plugin designed to make chemistry animations easier.

To my knowledge, there is another project called [chanim](https://github.com/kilacoda/chanim) that aims to import to manim the chemfig package (and does an amazing job!).

The philosophy of molnim goes into a different direction: Molnim tries to use the manim tools in combination with [.mol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file) files and [.csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) databases useful basic classes to create beatufil chemistry related animations such as a Periodic Table or 2d and 3d chemical structures.

Also, molnim will try to do as much things from scratch as possible. That means I will also avoid using libraries such as [Mendeleev](https://mendeleev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/), [PyMOL](https://pymol.org/2/), [Open Babel](https://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) ammong others. The reason is avoid depending on 3rd party packages that might need intensive maintenance. Also, learning how that software works is pretty interesting.

This project is still a work in progress and there is no date for a final realease yet.

# What can molnim do right now?

This will be a summary of the capabilities of molnim. As this project is still in progress this might not be up to date. Check the examples to get a better idea of what you can do. You might want to check the TODO file to know what is comming and yet to be done. 



## Reading .mol files

Molnim can parse .mol files to create a dictionary with atoms and bond data. Currently, the data we are getting is:

### Atoms: 
    - Index: To know the index in the .mol file, which allows us to keep track of bonding.  
    - Coordinates: Used to give a position to the atom.
    - Element: To know which element is it.
    - Bond to. Using the index of other atoms, we get to know to which atoms is bond a certain atom. 

### Bonds:
    - From atom: The index of the atom starting the bond
    - To atom: The index of the atom ending the bond
    - Type: Indicates the type of bond. Check [the bond block specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file#Bond_block_specification) for further info. 
    - Stereo: Usefull to know if a cram bond is needed and which kind. 


### How to use it:
This is used inside both 2d and 3d molecules but can be used independently importing it from the utils submodule.
